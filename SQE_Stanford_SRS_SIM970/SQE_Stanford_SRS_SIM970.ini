# Time (in seconds) before the timing out while waiting for an instrument response. Default is 5
timeout: 3

# Query instrument errors (True or False).  If True, every command sent to the device will
# be followed by an error query.  This is useful when testing new setups, but may degrade
# performance by slowing down the instrument communication.

# 5: Command error
# 6: User request
# 7: Power on

# Define quantities in sections. The section name should be the same as the "name" value
# The following keywords are allowed:
#   name:          Quantity name
#   unit:          Quantity unit
#   enabled:	   Determines wether the control is enabled from start.  Default is True	
#   datatype:      The data type should be one of DOUBLE, BOOLEAN, COMBO or STRING
#   def_value:     Default value
#   low_lim:       Lowest allowable value.  Defaults to -INF
#   high_lim:      Highest allowable values.  Defaults to +INF
#   combo_def_1:   First option in a pull-down combo box. Only used when datatype=COMBO
#   combo_def_2:   Second option in a pull-down combo box. Only used when datatype=COMBO
#   ...
#   combo_def_n:   nth option in a pull-down combo box. Only used when datatype=COMBO
#   group:         Name of the group where the control belongs.
#   state_quant:   Quantity that determines this control's visibility
#   state_value_1: Value of "state_quant" for which the control is visible
#   state_value_2: Value of "state_quant" for which the control is visible
#   ...
#   state_value_n: Value of "state_quant" for which the control is visible
#   permission:    Sets read/writability, options are BOTH, READ, WRITE or NONE. Default is BOTH 
#   set_cmd:       Command used to send data to the instrument. Put <*> where the value should appear.
#   sweep_cmd:     Command used to sweep data. Use <sr> for sweep rate, and <*> for the value.
#   get_cmd:       Command used to get the data from the instrument. Default is set_cmd?
